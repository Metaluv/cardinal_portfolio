## Your Journey into Python Programming

Python has become the lingua franca of engineering, data science, and automation. As someone balancing work, studies, and community projects, I've designed this learning path to be practical, efficient, and immediately applicable to real-world problems.

## Why Python for Engineers?

Python offers unique advantages for engineering applications:
- **Rapid prototyping** - Test ideas quickly
- **Scientific computing** - NumPy, SciPy, Pandas ecosystem
- **Automation** - Script repetitive tasks
- **Data analysis** - Process and visualize complex data
- **Machine learning** - Accessible AI/ML frameworks
- **Cross-platform** - Works everywhere

## The Three-Phase Learning Journey

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-8)

**Goal:** Build solid programming fundamentals

#### Module 1: Python Basics & Setup
Start with environment setup using Anaconda or Python.org. Learn variables, data types, and basic operations. Your first project: build a traditional calendar calculator that respects Indigenous lunar cycles alongside Gregorian dates.

#### Module 2: Control Flow & Logic
Master conditional statements and loops. Understand Boolean logic and operators. Project: Create a water usage tracker for garden irrigation optimization.

#### Module 3: Data Structures
Explore lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets. Learn list comprehensions for elegant code. Project: Design a crop rotation planner using data structures.

#### Module 4: Functions & Modules
Write reusable code with functions. Organize code into modules. Project: Build a greenhouse monitoring system with modular components.

### Phase 2: Intermediate (Weeks 9-16)

**Goal:** Master essential programming techniques

#### Module 5: Object-Oriented Programming
Create classes and objects. Understand inheritance and polymorphism. Apply encapsulation principles. Project: Develop a market garden inventory system.

#### Module 6: File Handling & Data Processing
Read and write various file formats. Process CSV and JSON data. Implement error handling. Project: Build a community survey analyzer.

#### Module 7: Scientific Computing
Use NumPy for numerical operations. Analyze data with Pandas. Create visualizations with Matplotlib. Project: Design an agricultural data dashboard.

#### Module 8: Engineering Applications
Apply SciPy for scientific computing. Use SymPy for symbolic math. Understand control systems basics. Project: Create an irrigation optimization model.

### Phase 3: Advanced (Weeks 17-24)

**Goal:** Professional-level Python skills

#### Module 9: Advanced Features
Master decorators and generators. Use context managers. Implement async programming. Project: Build real-time sensor monitoring.

#### Module 10: Database Integration
Learn SQL basics with SQLite. Use SQLAlchemy ORM. Apply database design principles. Project: Create a community knowledge base.

#### Module 11: Web Development & APIs
Build with Flask framework. Design RESTful APIs. Integrate frontend technologies. Project: Develop an elder knowledge portal.

#### Module 12: Machine Learning & AI
Apply Scikit-learn fundamentals. Introduction to deep learning. Respect Indigenous data sovereignty. Project: Build a crop yield predictor.

## Learning Philosophy: Two-Eyed Seeing

This approach combines Western programming logic with Indigenous problem-solving wisdom:
- **Holistic thinking** - See systems, not just code
- **Relationship focus** - Code serves community needs
- **Cyclical learning** - Revisit concepts with deeper understanding
- **Practical application** - Every concept tied to real use

## Setting Up Your Environment

### Quick Start with Anaconda
```bash
# Download Anaconda from anaconda.com
# Install with Python 3.11+
# Verify installation
conda --version
python --version

# Create learning environment
conda create -n pylearn python=3.11
conda activate pylearn
```

### Essential VS Code Setup
Install these extensions for optimal Python development:
- Python (Microsoft)
- Pylint (linting)
- Python Docstring Generator
- Jupyter (for notebooks)
- GitLens (version control)

## Core Python Concepts

### Variables and Data Types
```python
# Numbers
age = 35  # integer
height = 5.9  # float
complex_num = 3 + 4j  # complex

# Strings
name = "Jason Cardinal"
community = 'Bigstone Cree Nation'
multiline = """
This supports
multiple lines
"""

# Booleans
is_student = True
is_complete = False

# Collections
plants = ["tomato", "lettuce", "carrots"]  # list
coordinates = (54.0, -108.5)  # tuple
config = {"debug": True, "version": 1.0}  # dictionary
unique_items = {1, 2, 3, 3}  # set (stores {1, 2, 3})
```

### Control Flow Essentials
```python
# Conditional logic
temperature = 22
if temperature < 0:
    print("Freezing - protect plants!")
elif temperature < 10:
    print("Cold - growth will be slow")
elif temperature < 30:
    print("Optimal growing temperature")
else:
    print("Too hot - provide shade")

# Loops
# For loop with enumerate
crops = ["corn", "beans", "squash"]
for index, crop in enumerate(crops, 1):
    print(f"{index}. {crop}")

# While loop with condition
water_level = 100
while water_level > 20:
    print(f"Water level: {water_level}%")
    water_level -= 10
```

### Functions: Building Blocks
```python
def calculate_planting_date(frost_date, days_before):
    """
    Calculate when to start seeds indoors.
    
    Args:
        frost_date: Last expected frost (datetime)
        days_before: Days to start before frost
    
    Returns:
        Optimal planting date
    """
    from datetime import timedelta
    return frost_date - timedelta(days=days_before)

# Using default parameters
def water_plant(plant_name, amount_ml=500):
    return f"Watered {plant_name} with {amount_ml}ml"

# Variable arguments
def harvest_vegetables(*vegetables):
    for veg in vegetables:
        print(f"Harvested: {veg}")

harvest_vegetables("tomatoes", "peppers", "lettuce")
```

## Object-Oriented Programming Basics

```python
class Plant:
    """Represents a plant in our garden."""
    
    def __init__(self, name, species, days_to_harvest):
        self.name = name
        self.species = species
        self.days_to_harvest = days_to_harvest
        self.height = 0
        self.water_level = 50
        
    def water(self, amount):
        """Water the plant."""
        self.water_level = min(100, self.water_level + amount)
        return f"Watered {self.name}. Level: {self.water_level}%"
    
    def grow(self, days=1):
        """Simulate growth."""
        growth_rate = 0.5 * (self.water_level / 100)
        self.height += growth_rate * days
        self.water_level -= 5 * days

# Creating and using objects
tomato = Plant("Cherry Tomato", "Solanum lycopersicum", 65)
print(tomato.water(30))
tomato.grow(7)
```
